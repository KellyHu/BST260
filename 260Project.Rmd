An important part of your project is the RMarkdown and HTML files. This will detail your steps in developing your solution, including how you collected the data, alternative solutions you tried, describing statistical methods you used, and the insights you got. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your RMarkdown and HTML files are the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. We strongly advise you to include many visualizations.

## Overview and Motivation
Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.

It is widely acknowledged that students at colleges can sometimes be stressful because they are eager to get good grades to prepare better for their future career or academic development.  As the students from the school of Public Health at Harvard University, not only do we care about our grades, but we also want to make sure that college students are in healthy condition while pursuing  good GPAs.  Therefore, we are interested in how nutrition information is associated with the pressure and GPA of college kids.
